# Simple Hash Table implementation
I've used this implementation in a few assigments over the years. It is quite simple and concise but works beautifully fast. It is based on open adressing and can be easily modified to accept most kinds of value types.

This implementation completely ignores de hash function used, as it will depend strongly on the key type and universe.
